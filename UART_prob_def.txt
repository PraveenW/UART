Design a USART0 for the ATMega328. (The datasheet is in the modules section of Canvas). Pass the very simple u0tb.sv testbench (You will make a test bench later).

Submit your design file, and run results on Canvas.

Notes:

The u0tb.sv file can be found in the lab at ~morris/272hw

You will also find a sv_uvm file there which will run VCS in system verilog mode

To run the code use

./sv_uvm u0tb.sv

Your design must be called u0.sv

The design must synthesize.

You must use the interface in the test bench
